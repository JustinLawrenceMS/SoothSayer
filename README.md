<h3>A fortune telling mobile app</h3>

This app supplies a random passage from the public domain
medieval poem, the Rubaiyyat, everytime the app is loaded.
It was created with frontend technologies such as React, 
React Native, and Expo, while backend technologies such as
Laravel, PHP and MySQL supply the business logic that makes
the app work.

Download the github repo and navigate to app root.

```git clone https://github.com/JustinLawrenceMS/SoothSayer.git```

```cd SoothSayer```

Install dependencies with the following command:

```npm i```

Then start expo by doing this:

```npx expo start```

Follow the instructions on the Expo site for how
to load an Expo app.
